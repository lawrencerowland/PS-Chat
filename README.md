# PS-Chat
The code for delivering the ChatBot project for PS

# Step 0. Install the Requirements in your terminal

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

# Step 1: Prepare your own documents for chatbot talk to PDF documents

## 1.a: Upload your own documents
Put your documents into ``./docs/[category_name]/`` . Each ``[category_name]`` of subfolder will appear as tickboxes so that you can choose one or multiple categories of sources of PDF document for reference. Please create a subfolder inside the ./docs with and carefully name ``[category_name]``, because it will be used for storing your document in the cloud vector database.

## 1.b: Upload your own questions
Create a  ```questions.txt``` file for each category of documents and put each question on a new line. Put your example questions in the ``` ./docs/[cat_name]/ ``` folder containing the relevent documents for that set of questions.

# Step 2: Set your environment file as .env in the main folder

[See below regarding where to find your neo4j, OpenAI and Pinecone keys](#find-your-api-keys).

```
# Graph Database for Chatbot talk to documents
NEO4J_URL="xxxxx"
NEO4J_USER="xxxxx"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="xxxxx"

# Your openai key 
OPENAI_KEY="xxxxx"

# Setting of Vector database
PINECONE_KEY = "xxxxx"
PINECONE_ENV = "xxxxx"
PINECONE_INDEX = "xxxxx"

# Name of directory for storing PDF documents
PDF_DOC_DIR = "./docs" 

# Upload parameters of PDF doucment into vector database
CHUNK_SIZE = 1000 
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 0

# Namespace for vector database
PINECONE_PDF_NAMESPACE = "my-pdf" 
PINECONE_GRAPH_NAMESPACE = "my-graph" 

```

## Find your API keys

- Visit [OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) to retrieve API keys and insert into your .env file.
- Visit [Pinecone](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/quickstart#2-get-and-verify-your-pinecone-api-key) to create and retrieve your API keys, and also retrieve your environment and index name from the dashboard.
- Visit [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/browser-manual/current/operations/dbms-connection/) to retrieve URL


# Step 3: Ingest your data

## 3.a: Ingest your documents
This could take a while if you have multiple documents. This function will upload the embeddings of your PDF documents and graph database to the cloud vector database.
You can uncomment the graph ingesting if you only want to upload a new pdf.

```
python ingest_data.py
```

## 3.b: Create document structure
This function will create a client_doc_structure.json file in the ./data folder. The UI will populate the Source Selection, Document Display and Questions sections with this data. If there are files locally in the ./docs folder, these will be used instead.

## 3.c: Put 'title_url_mapping.json' into ./data folder (Optional)
This approach show your the url instead of pdf document.

# Step 4. Launch your app
After ingesting your data, simply run main.py for local deployment and debugging.

```
python main.py
```

## Option 1. Deploy your app using Gunicorn

```
gunicorn -w 2 -b :8000 main:app --timeout=120
```

## Option 2. For port forwarding using Ngrok
Please refer https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/
